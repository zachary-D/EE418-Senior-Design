Fig2dev is a set of tools for creating TeX documents with graphics
which are portable, in the sense that they can be printed in a wide
variety of environments.

Fig2dev consists of the fig2dev and the transfig commands.  The fig2dev
command translates Fig code to other graphic description languages.  The
transfig command generates transfig.tex, a macro file for \input in a
TeX document, and a Makefile which translates Fig code to various
graphics description languages using the fig2dev program.  Currently,
transfig is considered obsolete, and it is not maintained any longer.
By default, transfig is not built.  To build transfig, enable it
explicitly with ./configure --enable-transfig.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

The transfig directory contains the source for the transfig command
which generates a Makefile which translates Fig code to various graphics
description languages using the fig2dev program.  In previous releases,
this command was implemented as a shell script.

The fig2dev directory contains a general program for translating from
Fig code to other graphics desciption languages.  The dev subdirectory
contains a library of output drivers used by fig2dev.

The man directory contains man pages for fig2dev and for the transfig
command. The doc directory contains a manual for using TransFig to
create documents with portable graphics.

Fig2dev and its companion xfig are available from

Runtime Requirements
********************

o As of version 3.2.0 (final), fig2dev has taken over the translating of Fig
  to the bitmap formats (ACAD, GIF, JPEG, XPM, XBM, PCX, TIFF).
  In the past, xfig itself rendered the bitmap formats.  This change was made
  to have a more consistent look and better fonts.  First, the Fig file is
  translated to PostScript, then ghostscript is used to render the image to
  the final format in the case of JPEG, PCX and TIFF, or to PPM (portable
  pixmap) after which the appropriate ppmtoXXX filter is used to get ACAD, GIF,
  XPM and XBM.  If smoothing is done (-S option) when jpeg output is used, the
  "ppmtojpeg" program must be installed from the netpbm package.

  o You need the netpbm package version 9.1 (or later), which you can find at
    http://download.sourceforge.net/netpbm

  o You will also need ghostscript, which can be found on ftp.cs.wisc.edu in
    /ghost/aladdin, *AND* it must be compiled with the pcx256, jpeg, png256,
    ppmraw and tiff24nc drivers.

o To use the -a (binary) option for CGM export, the ralcgm program is
  required. This is available from ftp://ftp.cc.rl.ac.uk/pub/graphics/ralcgm/
