	Installation under Windows
	--------------------------

For compilation under Windows, a rudimentary Makefile is provided in the
fig2dev subdirectory. From the commandline, navigate to this subdirectory,
and issue the command

  name /f Nmakefile

For installation, you would manually have to copy the folder i18n/ to the
location given in the Nmakefile. Chances are good that fig2dev works to
your satisfaction also without these files. You may also give the location
of a color definition file in the Nmakefile.

Requirements
------------

At run-time, fig2dev needs ghostscript to convert fig-files to pdf, and
ghostscript and the netpbm package to convert to any bitmap file.
In addition, the jpeg, png, and xpm-libraries may be needed.


	Installation under Unix, Linux, Darwin (MacOS)
	----------------------------------------------

To compile and install fig2dev, issue the commands

  ./configure && make && make install

When compiling from the development sources, do

   autoreconf -i

before giving the three commands above.
An alternative is

  ./configure CFLAGS='-O2 -Wno-parentheses' && make -j && make install-strip

The latter will strip the debugging symbols from the executables.  The
-j option causes make to try a parallel build with multiple threads.
The CFLAGS are passed to the compiler.

Optionally,

  ./configure; make; make check; make install; make installcheck

will run tests (make check) with the freshly built executable still at
its location in the build tree, and (make installcheck) with the
executable installed in its final location.

Under Darwin, necessary libraries and header files are often installed
in non-standard locations.  These locations can be given in the LDFLAGS
and CPPFLAGS variables.  For instance, with packages installed from
macports, try
  ./configure LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include
or with packages from fink, try
  ./configure LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/sw/include

The commands above will compile fig2dev and copy the executables fig2dev,
fig2ps2tex and pic2tpic to /usr/local/bin.  Three man-pages for these
binaries are put into /usr/local/man/man1.  Furthermore, files which may
be needed at runtime are put under /usr/local/share/fig2dev.  These are
internationalization files, which may be used by the PostScript and all
bitmap output languages.  They are stored under
/usr/local/share/fig2dev/i18n.


	Options
	-------

The configure script and also the make-command can be customized in
many ways, either by giving options, e.g., ./configure --prefix=/usr,
or by setting variables, e.g., make CC=clang or ./configure CFLAGS=-O2.

Options relevant for fig2dev are, here given with their default
settings,
  --prefix=/usr/local
  --bindir=${prefix}/bin
  --datarootdir=${prefix}/share
  --mandir=${prefix}/man
Compilation flags are typically
  CC=gcc CFLAGS='-g -O2' LIBS='-lXpm -lpng -lz -lm'

Try
  ./configure --prefix=/tmp/fig2dev; make install
and
  ls -R /tmp/fig2dev or tree /tmp/fig2dev
to see all files that are installed.

To get a list of possible features to enable or disable, type
  ./configure --help
and see the "Optional Features" and "Optional Packages" sections.


	Requirements
	------------

On debian, to build fig2dev, you will need the header files contained
in
  libc6-dev and linux-libc-dev.
Optionally, to read and embed png and jpeg-images, header files
contained in the packages
  libpng12-dev, zlib1g-dev, libjpeg-dev,
are needed. To read xpm images, in addition you will need
  libxpm-dev, libxt-dev, libX11-dev.

At runtime and for the tests run by make check, the packages
  ghostscript and netpbm
are needed to produce various bitmap output formats.
