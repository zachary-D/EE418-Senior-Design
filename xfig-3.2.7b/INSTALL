Type

	./configure; make; make install

to build xfig and install it below /usr/local. Optionally, run
`make check' after make and `make installcheck', after installation.

Important options to configure are
	--prefix=<path>		root of installation tree, default /usr/local
	--without-xpm-icon	disable the xpm splash icon
	--with-appdefaultdir=<path>	directory to install the X resources
				file to, default $prefix/share/X11/app-defaults/
	--with-icondir=<path>	directory to install the xfig icon to,
				default $prefix/share/pixmaps/
	--with-applicationsdir=<path>	directory for the xfig.desktop file,
				default $prefix/share/applications/
	--without-xfig-libraries	do not install xfig libraries files,
				currently 2531 fig files, 16 MB.
Type ./configure --help for all options.
When running ./configure, the values of various flags are printed at the
very end of its output.

On Mac Darwin, OS X 10.11.1 (El Capitan), using XQuartz and having installed
jpeg, libpng and zlib via Macports, the following command should work:
	./configure LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include \
		--with-appdefaultdir=/opt/X11/share/X11/app-defaults
	make -j; make install-strip
The option -j does a parallel build. The target install-strip strips debugging
symbols from the executable.
To install xfig under /usr/share on debian, try
	./configure --prefix=/usr --with-appdefaultdir=/etc/X11/app-defaults
	make -j; make install

On old systems, it may be necessary to define ANCIENT from the make command,
	./configure; make -DANCIENT; make install
The preprocessor macro ANCIENT can not be defined by ./configure,
but must be set when invoking make.

Please report bug fixes or suggestions for improvement
to thomas.loimer@tuwien.ac.at. I am also very interested to learn about
conditions where it is necessary to compile with make -DANCIENT.
