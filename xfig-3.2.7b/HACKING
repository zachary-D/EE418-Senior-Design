Compiling from development sources
----------------------------------

To build from the development sources, the autoconf tools must be installed.
In the top source directory, do
  autoreconf -i
# -i ... install missing files (depmod, install-sh, etc.)
  ./configure; make; make install

Alternatives: make -sj, make install-strip (strips debugging symbols).
Optionally, make check and, after installing, make install-check.
Only very rudimentary tests are provided, thus not much is gained
from running them.

The version of the package is given in the file version.m4.
Edit the file to adapt the version string. If the sources are maintained
in a git-tree, with
  ./configure --enable-versioning
the script update-version_m4 is run and changes the version string to a
string given by git describe.
